## Bring back the first Scratch 2 blue.

I don't support the the new blue on Scratch. It is too "flashy".  
Maybe you do too ?  
Here's the userstyle made for you!

### Installing
1. Install a userstyle manager ([Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) is the best for privacy)
2. Click [here](https://github.com/csourcesc/old-scratch-blue/raw/master/old-scratch-blue.user.css), then install the style!
3. You're done! Enjoy the first Scratch 2 blue.
4. Something not in the old blue ? [File a feature request](https://github.com/csourcesc/old-scratch-blue/issues/new).
